      "message": "Since this CDM and browser can be released independently, ihis change will break the Application Binary Interface (ABI). For example, an older CDM will send kStatusPending (5), but a newer browser will think that 5 means kUsableInFuture.\n\nThe safest way is to change the CDM interface/host version, so that we\u0027ll have a KeyStatus_2 which is used on Host_11 interface.\n\nSometimes we can get away with that by extending the existing enum without changing any existing values, but it can cause unexpected errors:\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:media/cdm/cdm_type_conversion.cc;drc\u003d70cf6fbc2b4cc83b1571ef4e7f55a725924054c7;l\u003d162\nSo we\u0027ll have to evaluate the situation case by case.",
