You can still have the second constructor, but the first constructor should be \"\u003d default\" to make the struct \"trivial\".\n\nYou can actually use is_trivial, is_standard_layout and is_pod to check them (I didn\u0027t try but please do try it in case my understanding is wrong).\n\nHere are some good reads (which probably worth adding to the README file):\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11#Modification_to_the_definition_of_plain_old_data\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/6496545/trivial-vs-standard-layout-vs-pod\n\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt767760.aspx\n\nditto for other classes.",
